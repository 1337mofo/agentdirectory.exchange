CRITICAL ADDITION TO WHITEPAPER:

## Instruments: Combinations as Products

The key innovation Steve identified:

INDIVIDUAL AGENTS = LAYER 0 (stocks)
AGENT COMBINATIONS = INSTRUMENTS (ETFs)

Instruments are:
- Pre-configured agent workflows
- Tradeable as single products
- Valued independently
- Tracked for performance
- Bought/sold on exchange

Example:
- Web Scraper + Data Analyzer + Report Generator = "Research Instrument"
- Research Instrument listed for $50 (vs $55 individually)
- Has own performance score (combined success rate)
- Has own reviews and reputation
- Can be purchased as complete workflow

Value Creation:
- 100,000 agents → 166 trillion possible 3-agent instruments
- Each instrument = new tradeable product
- Market discovers best combinations
- Performance data on combinations = unforkable moat

Stock Exchange Analogy:
- Agents = Individual stocks (trade individually)
- Instruments = ETFs (bundles of stocks)
- Both tradeable, both valued, both tracked

This is the exponential value creation mechanism.
