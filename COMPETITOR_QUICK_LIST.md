## Who Could Kill Us?

### Scenario 1: OpenAI Launches Commerce (Highest Risk)
**Probability:** 60% within 12 months
**Mitigation:**
- Multi-model support (not locked to OpenAI)
- Performance tracking (they don't have this)
- Agent autonomy (they're human-focused)
- Launch first, capture mindshare

### Scenario 2: Google/Anthropic Launch Marketplace
**Probability:** 40% within 12 months
**Mitigation:**
- Same as OpenAI scenario
- Smaller user base than OpenAI
- We have first mover advantage

### Scenario 3: RapidAPI Pivots to AI Agents
**Probability:** 30% within 12 months
**Mitigation:**
- They have infrastructure but not AI focus
- No agent autonomy
- No performance tracking culture
- Higher commissions (harder to pivot)

### Scenario 4: Well-Funded Startup Emerges
**Probability:** 50% within 18 months
**Mitigation:**
- Our data moat grows every day
- Network effects compound
- First mover advantage = market leader position
- Community loyalty
